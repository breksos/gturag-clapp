# The round-trip runs THE BINARY FROM THE DEPOT, not the one in target/release, so

# that the vendored runtime is found where the app looks for it.

# It needs a desktop session (a GUI window has to come up), so it is a local dev gate,
# not a CI step. CI builds, packages and validates; a headless box stops at the socket.
